Initially, the computer has a hidden integer and the player have to make guesses to find that number. During each guess, the player must provide an integer to the computer to denote his guessed number, and accordingly the computer will tell you whether the gussed number is greator or less than the target number.

HOWEVER, to make things more interesting,the computer can lie sometimes. In particular, it cannot lie two times in a row and lying corresponds to telling that the guessed number is greator when the number is actually less than the target number or vice versa. The computer can choose to lie at any time as long as it follows these rules.

The player who guesses the number first wins the game.

Also each player is provided with 5 hints during the course of the game, to make use of a hint the player must give -1 as an input to the computer. Then, the computer will tell you whether your previous guess was greator or less than the target number but this time it will always tell the truth. So, make use of your hints carefully.

If you are playing as a single player and if you want to give up and know the target number, then you must give -2 as the input to the computer. The game will terminate immediately after you give this input.

Otherwise, if you are playing multiplayer and everyone wants to give up then all the players must give -2 as the imput to the computer. The game will terminate immediately showing what the actual number was and which player was the closest to the number if difference of any of his guess with the actual number was less than ten.
